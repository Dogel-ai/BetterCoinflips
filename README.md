# BetterCoinflips
SCP:SL plugin that adds a Risk-Reward mechanic to the in-game coin. Whenever you flip a coin a 'random' effect will happen depending on the coinflips outcome.
This plugin is a property of Miki_hero using it is obviously allowed, but if you want to expand on it or use parts of it in any way do give me credit.

**Features:**

- Whenever someone flips a coin and it lands on heads one of the following will happen:  
1. A Containment Engineer keycard will spawn at their feet.  
2. A 'medic' kit will spawn at their feet consisting of a medkit and painkillers.  
3. They will be teleported to the doors leading straight to the escape zone.  
4. They will be healed by 25 health (it can go over 100!).  
5. Their hp will be multiplied by 1.5.  
- Whenever someone flips a coin and it lands on tails one of the following will happen:  
1. Their hp will be set to 70% of their current health.  
2. They will be teleported to Class D containment cells.  
3. A random effect will be applied to them for 10 seconds.  
4. Warhead will be enabled or disabled depending on it's current status (propably won't work if it's already detonated).  
5. Lights all across the map will be turned off for 10 seconds.  

**This plugin is still in development so don't expect it to be balanced or work perfectly!**
